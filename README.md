# Optimizing-Online-Sports-Retail-Revenue
## Project Description
Sports clothing is a booming sector!

In this notebook, I have used SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

In this project, i’ll will work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

And will use techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!
## TASK LIST
Count the total number of products, along with the number of non-missing values in description, listing_price, and last_visited

Find out how listing_price varies between Adidas and Nike products.

Create labels for products grouped by price range and brand.

Calculate the average discount offered by brand.

Calculate the correlation between reviews and revenue.

Split description into bins in increments of one hundred characters, and calculate average rating by for each bin.

Count the number of reviews per brand per month.

Create the footwear CTE, then calculate the number of products and average revenue from these items.

Copy the code used to create footwear then use a filter to return only products that are not in the CTE.

## CONCLUSION

The brand needs to explore opportunities to develop products in the “Expensive” and “Elite” categories that have higher revenue potential.

Focusing on product quality, customer service, and holistic marketing strategies can help improve reviews and revenue.

Analyzing factors that influence monthly review fluctuations and planning appropriate marketing strategies.

Continuously monitoring product categories like footwear and clothing and making relevant price adjustments or marketing strategies.

Using this data as a foundation to design more effective and customer-oriented business strategies.

All of these recommendations can assist the brand in enhancing product performance, increasing revenue, and providing a better experience to customers.
