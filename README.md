# Optimizing-Online-Sports-Retail-Revenue
## Project Description
Sports clothing is a booming sector!

In this notebook, I have used SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

In this project, iâ€™ll will work with numeric, string, and timestamp data on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic.

And will use techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!
